Consistency checks are based on the JSON response, not based on the implemented evaluation logic:
    FV != very first project version (?)
    #FV = 1
    #AV > 1



Is it necessary to sort versions? Could implicate problems during IV and OV evaluation?

Inconsistency between no AV (empty array) and no IV (null).

Check if OV is correctly evaluated.
