    check every method uses @null/@non-null descriptors as old project
--  check if methods are reusable
    check if logic is correct
    check sonar
    maintain warnings about @non-null checks
--  add javadoc
    \n for each log
    error handling of controllers is chosen by explicit exception throwing of service methods
    always call local methods without class name before
    throws exception can have \n at the end?
    less info of tickets respect old isw project
--  distinguish between fixedversion and List fixedversions -> we will set it inside ticket cleaner
    check logic and @nullable/nonnull annotations, also doble check with ai
    check everything is rewritten as in old project
    group methods inside JiraScraper and reuse
--  do some test cases
--  sonar is tagging smells regarding @Nonnullable checks, but is still common practice to hold them (maybe change the rule)

--  rewrite all old classes
--  try to set fixversion with findoldest or findnewest methods. check if reusable
-- @NonNull and @Nullable annotations should be more consistent regarding the reason of their use
-- redundant checks are highlighted only if using @nullable annotations for both callers and called methods
-- check before if methods need/are using correctly @NonNull/@Nullable annotations for their parameters and return values,
                    NEXT check if callers are respecting the contract and look for null/empty checks for both string, obj, list, etc...
-- migrate methods to lightweight JiraScraper class
