Consistency checks are based on the JSON response, not based on the implemented evaluation logic:
    FV != very first project version (?)
    #FV = 1
    #AV > 1
    git commit related



Is it necessary to sort versions? Could implicate problems during IV and OV evaluation?

Inconsistency between no AV (empty array) and no IV (null). Check what "missing" var means in JSON context and Model context and csv context.

Check if OV is correctly evaluated.

x% to include/exclude.

Proportion.

Remove warning where it is possible.

Read all the codebase again.

Do we want non-released versions?

make the ticket fields real version objects?

no versions names duplicates are supported.
