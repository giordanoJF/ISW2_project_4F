--  check every method uses @null/@non-null descriptors as old project
--  check if methods are reusable
--  check sonar
--  add javadoc
--  \n for each log
--  always call local methods without class name before
--  distinguish between fixedversion and List fixedversions -> we will set it inside ticket cleaner
--  check everything is rewritten as in old project
--  do some test cases

--  rewrite all old classes
-- migrate methods to lightweight JiraScraper class
-- use @NonNull/@Nullable annotations also in other classes
-- change profile on laptop of intellij to use @NonNull/@Nullable annotations
-- check the csv has all expected fields

-- JiraScraper is now ok, but we will need to raise reuse of methods and improve all null checks
                (reading the flow of the code, when the class should raise an exception or continue the flow)
-- in JiraScraper some logic is not consistent, sometimes empty list raise an exception, sometimes not.
-- JiraScraper could be improved by a better handling of empty lists or null values. it throws exceptions a lot.
